# PHP Operators

Welcome to the source code for [php-operators.com](https://php-operators.com)!

What do you do when you see PHP code with an exotic operator like `**` you don't come across every day? Ask AI of course! Yeah, we're late to the party. We started this project around 2020. The content was almost all written, but we wanted to build a cool interface for itâ€” and we finally got to it! You can browse, search, filter, or jump to a random operator. Give it a read, you might learn something new!

This web app is built with Laravel, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. Content is stored in Markdown files and loaded with our [sheets](https://github.com/spatie/sheets) package.
